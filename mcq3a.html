         <h3>The mouse on your computer screen starts to move around on its own and click on things on your desktop. What do you do?</h3>
         <h4>B-Disconnect your computer from the network and inform your supervisor.</h4>
            <p>Immediately report the problem to your supervisor.Also, since it seems possible that someone is controlling the computer remotely, it is best if you can disconnect the computer from the network until help arrives.If possible, don't turn off the computer.</p>

         <h2> Real life scenario</h2>
         <h4>B- Delete the mail.</h4>
            <p>Delete the email. Better yet, use the web client (e.g. gmail, yahoo mail, etc.) and report it as spam or phishing, then delete it. Any unsolicited email or phone call asking you to enter your account information, disclose your password, financial account information, social security number, or other personal or private information is suspicious – even if it appears to be from a company you are familiar with. Always contact the sender using a method you know is legitimate to verify that the message is from them.</p>
